Anytime I write or talk about this I see how my career had a dynamic path. I did not find too many folks that enjoy so much doing both design, coding and build products at simultaneouslly. I'll explain.

My first professional step was dive into editorial world as a **graphic designer** in 1994, on a large company called CPAD. The way I got inside this company still makes me proud when I think about it. I saw a book, and as Photoshop addict at the time, I thought that I could do it, then I took a bus to the company's address, talk with a security guy and on 3rd talk, I met the guy that shaped my executive feelings. Ruy Berstein was his name. He was not so cordial as we usually see on most places, and as always, he pushed me straight to the point: "what you want?" followed by "do you know how to do that?" them "come with me." He gave me a challenge with task no one inside the company was able to get done, and my timeline was 24h to show my competence on that. I spend all day on it, all night, and wasn't able to do anything that I thought I knew, all my skill were suddenly frozen! I did something, tough. It didn't worked and was not approved by people there in the company. But he said to me these exactly words, without looking to me: "you don't know what you think you know, but you're on a path to go beyond it. I could give you a chance that I am right, opening a position that doesn't exist today, and we let's see what happens. Do you want it?". At this point, I knew 2 things: I had a very limited time to answer and it was a yes/no kind of question. I though something like "I need to go beyond his question to get inside his head, and I answered with a new question: "When do I start?". Finally I've managed to make him stop moving and doing something else while talking with me, and he looked at me and said: "tomorrow". I need to do a break here to extract an important lesson I learned for life: **have an executive mind always means be pragmatic while looking for the beyond a step we're about to take**. That was my start on professional career. 

Working on night turns, from 22h to 8h, on my going home routine I used to cross within the multitude of "normal" day employees. After, 10 hard months, I got promoted and became one of them. At this point, I had mastered all the flows and tools for build books, news papper, and any printed or digital produt the company work with. This include mastering Photoshop hacking, Pagemaker and even the printting workflow from PDFs to Speedmaster's jobs queue. After sometime I get a feeling of "done" about static things, and wanted to move on to the new world of web and dynamic things that was just starting for us. Then I started to connect my self with folks on Flash forums to became am Actionscript master, something powerfull enough that allowed me to do advanced programming and design at same time, and for web! That was a high speed and learnign time, when my foundations were being built. Once again, I got on some sort of loop, and want to go further, but using my knowledge, and leads me to the eLearning industry as a versatile developer and swiftly advancing to Engineering Manager at EduWeb, I've always been propelled by a drive for innovation and excellence. This drive was instrumental in EduWeb's ascent to the pinnacle of the Brazilian market, culminating in its evolution into Affero Lab, the largest eLearning provider in Latin America. Throughout this journey, my role expanded to encompass LMS infrastructure, coding, content development, and team leadership, laying a solid groundwork for my subsequent ventures.

In 2012, I made a pivotal shift towards mobile development, focusing on the Apple platform, while continuing to contribute to the eLearning sector on a freelance basis for notable clients. This period of dual engagement enriched my expertise and set the stage for my tenure at Enjoei and Peixe Urbano. At Peixe Urbano, I initiated and led a transformative campaign to overhaul the mobile app experience for iOS users. This endeavor not only significantly improved our product but also helped increase the app's contribution to company revenue from 30% to approximately 70%. This success paved the way for my roles as Mobile Manager and, eventually, CTO of Peixe, navigating the company through significant growth and acquisition phases.

My commitment to driving value through collaborative leadership was further demonstrated during my tenure at Delivery Much. Where my first initial challenge was solve metrics and transparency for Product and Engineering areas. My strategic realignments fostered a culture of performance and open communication. This approach restored the company's trajectory towards product innovation and operational efficiency.

Additionally, my entrepreneurial spirit led me to co-found QRTraining, where I spearheaded technology development, showcasing my ability to innovate and scale solutions in competitive markets.

After Peixe, I joined Singu as CTO, skillfully guiding the company through a critical transition culminating in its acquisition by Natura. This experience underscored my expertise in aligning product and engineering visions with broader business objectives, ensuring seamless integration and value creation.

In 2022, facing my daughter’s health challenge, I momentarily stepped back to support her, showcasing my ability to balance professional responsibilities with personal commitments. This episode not only strengthened my resilience but also deepened my appreciation for life’s priorities.

Recently, starting early in 2023, my passion for Artificial Intelligence has led me to engage with cutting-edge technologies, including OpenAI's GPTs, and to develop AI-driven solutions that enhance user engagement and operational efficiency. This endeavor is not only a testament to my continuous learning ethos but also positions me at the forefront of technological innovation.

As a humanitarian and technologist, my contributions extend beyond the professional sphere. My involvement in WinEver, an AI Coach for League of Legends players, and the development of an AI-powered assistant to support children affected by leukemia, illustrate my commitment to leveraging technology for societal benefit.

In summary, my career is characterized by a blend of technical proficiency, visionary leadership, and a deep commitment to societal impact, making me a valuable asset to any organization poised for transformative growth.
